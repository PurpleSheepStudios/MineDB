#Database Design

#users
userID      - autogenerated number
username    - the minecraft username of the player (check what the restrictions are for minecraft)
password    - their password to access and upload builds (will be salted then hashed) (var char 255)
salt        - the salt used on the password before hashing
dateJoined  - the date the user signed up (not important but might be nice for later features)

#builds
buildID     - autogenerated number
buildName   - the name for the build (var char 30)
buildDesc   - a description for the build (var char 255)
buildData   - the build's block data. This will store the 3D matrix (might be compressed) of the structure (BLOB)
buildImg    - a 32x32 image of the build. This will be obtained in game when the user 'saves' the build (BLOB)

#contributors
userID      - the id of a user
buildID     - the id of a build that the above user contributes to.

By having contributions as a link table (rather than the userID being a foerign key in the builds table)
we can have multiple contributors to one build
